                            greatly reducing environment drift and developer onboarding time.</p>
                        <p>Designed and implemented automated build and testing pipeline using Jenkins and Docker

                        <p>Planned and executed migration from single host bare-metal production setup to a cloud
                            environment (K8s on AWS) with a focus on reducing the technical knowledge needed for
                            developer to release code and manual effort required. This enabled code to be shipped much
                            more often and reliably.</p>
                        <p>Identified key application bottlenecks and single points of failure during major outage.
